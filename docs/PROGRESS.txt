==== Pending Tasks ====
General
- codec support - how?
- compile to EXE
VidHandler
- somehow detect VFPS
- if CFPS, run through initially to accurately get vid length/frame count
Motion
- poll system time before and after analysis
- needs option to start at X time (ie to ignore camera focusing at start)
- may need option to ignore area of video
- command-line: set mode and settings

==== Log ====
July 9 2014
- started building MainGUI.py
July 11-13 2014
- worked on MainGUI.py
  - main window done (600x300)
  - start/stop deltas started
  - basic menus made
  - started on validating settings inputs
July 14 2014
- worked on MainGUI.py
  - adjusted window size and positioning (larger, 800x420)
  - added scrollbars to the file list
    - working on mouse wheel functionality
August 21 2014
- worked on VidHandler.py
  - successfully opened and played a video
  - note: looks like only uncompressed AVIs are OK atm
  - can successfully get vid dimensions, CFPS, frame count, duration
  - can also get the time of the current frame based on its index
August 22 2014
- worked on VidHandler.py
  - added handles for Motion.py
- worked on Motion.py
  - started command-line interface
  - laid framework for motion detection (no actual function yet)
August 26 2014
- worked on Motion.py
  - improved command-line input options
  - can now use OpenCV without needing to install it
  - working on getting no-install codec integration
August 27 2014
- worked on Motion.py
  - finally figured out how to get it to recognize ffmpeg
    - codec files will probably need to be placed in the same folder
    - however, FFmpeg is versatile, maybe we won't need any more?
August 28 2014
- worked on Motion.py
  - implemented image differential, can be used for thresholding or obj detection
September 2014
- worked on Motion.py
  - added command-line interface
  - implemented thresholding and contrast methods
  - not quite working, different methods of counting pixels don't agree
    - also, grayscaling isn't working
October 9 2014
- worked on Motion.py
  - fixed grayscaling and contrast methods
  - cleaned up analysis method's structure
  - implemented motion detection from contrast in differential imaage
  - started working on motion intervals
October 10 2014
- worked on Motion.py
  - also fully implemented intervals
  - fixed output
  - tweaking values to find ideal ranges
  - added maximum sensitivity threshold - if more change than this, no motion
    - intended to reduce errors due to light or camera shifts
  - need to fix bug where video length is slightly overestimated
  - backed up build to allow for cleaning-up of old code
October 2014
- continued to adjust
- started to implement interval merging for intervals that are very close together - recursive method not working, returns 0 intervals
November 6 2014
- replaced recursive merging with looped merging, works OK
  - still have to confirm these intervals
November 7 2014
- tested merged intervals against video
  - didn't get 100% of all bees
    - large number of missed bees between intervals
  - got a good number of false positives
    - included a lot of noise intervals
    - also initial camera/light still caused interval
  - next step: check if merging was causing loss of intervals
  - next step: adjust sensitivity (less), reduce buffer, merge threshold
  - still have to fix time stretch
- Settings for next test run:
  mothre 0.1, mobuff 5, merthr 2, mosens 1.5e-4, mostop 0.0025
- Data (itvs, mitvs, manual x2) for CSEE vid has been saved for review, comparison
